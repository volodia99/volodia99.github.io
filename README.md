This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project forked and and adapted from https://github.com/kvnol/kevinoliveira.com.br

## Getting Started

If you want to fork/clone this project to build/deploy your own github page, you can first try to run the development server locally, using a Node version manager like [npm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying the files and directories inside the `src/pages` directory. The page auto-updates as you edit these files. All images and files are located in the `public` directory.
